* PowerNex
PowerNex is a kernel written in the [[https://dlang.org][D Programming Language]].
The goal is to have a whole OS written in D, where PowerNex powers the core.

The name PowerNex comes from the words `power` and `next`. A kernel to power the
next generation of hardware.
** Building
It requires a crosscompiler, see link below for download.
It uses my build system called [[https://github.com/Vild/Wild][Wild]].
It expects the wild binary to be located in the root directory of PowerNex, then
you just need to run `./build` to build.

*Please note that Wild is under development and the compiled result may not work!*
*This means that it is recommended to use the prebuilt executable below*

[[https://definewild.se/PowerNex-Toolchain-03-10-2016.tar.xz][Prebuild toolchain (wild and compilers) for (Arch)Linux x64]]

One tip is to run `source env.sh`, this adds shortcuts for building and running.
	`b` compiles and runs PowerNex in qemu, `v` just builds PowerNex.
** System requirements
- A 64bit processor
- At least 128 MiB of ram (Probably work on less)

*Recommended & Supported Virtual Machines*
- QEMU
-- Recommended launch command ~qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom PowerNex.iso -m 128 -no-reboot~
- VirtualBox

** Thanks to
- Adam D. Ruppe - For his [[http://arsdnet.net/dcode/minimal.zip][minimal.zip]], which contains a bare bone minimal d runtime. Which this kernel is based on.
- Bloodmanovski - For his D Kernel [[https://github.com/Bloodmanovski/Trinix][Trinix]], His files for booting x64 really helped me a lot.
